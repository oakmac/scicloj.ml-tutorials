["### Special keys in metamorph context map"]
["A metamorph context map can contain arbitrary keys. Three keys are
 special and they enable the functioning of the pipeline . All steps should
handle them in the same way."]

[" `:metamorph/data` contains the main data object, the pipeline
 is supposed to manipulate. The type of object can be anything for `metamorph.ml`,
but all functionality in `scicloj.ml` requires it to be a `tech.v3.dataset`
 instance. For further information see in
 [metamorph](https://github.com/scicloj/metamorph)"]


["`:metamorph/mode` is used by 'model' functions, which get fitted from data or transform data.
Two modes are standardized, namely: `:fit` and `:transform`. In machine learning they often are called train / predict.
`sciform.ml` requires them to be `:fit` and `:transform`, and
third party libraries should adhere to this convention.
"]

["`:metamorph/id` contains at every step a different , unique, id. A model function can use it
to store the trained model in :fit and use it it :transform for prediction"]


["By default the value of `:metamorph/id` is set to a unique uuid. In some cases it can be useful to overwrite this auto-generated id.
This can be done by pre-pending any step function with a map. The map gets merged with the usual context map for this step, before the
step function is executed:

["Two functions in `scicloj.ml` use two further keys with the purpose of model evaluation, see further down in this guide."]
["The function `scicloj.ml.core/model` stores the feature-dataset and the inference-target-dataset in the ctx before doing a prediction

["### Custom model function"]

["In this chapter we see how to build a custom metamorph compliant function, which behaves like a simple model.
It takes the mean of the training data and applies this the to the test data.
So this function need to behave differently in mode: fit then in mode :transform.
"]

We have values for time step 1-10, and want to predict (using the mean),
the value for future time steps.

(def test-data
  (ds/dataset {:time [11 12 13 14 15]
               :val [nil nil  nil nil nil]}))

["Next we create the model function. It makes use of namespaced
key destructuring, which allows very compact code.

The :id,:data and :mode keys from the context,
become local bindings.

In :mode :fit, we calculate the mean of the (training) data and store it in ctx under an `id` which is passed to
the function by `metamorph` and is a unique id of the step.
This we use then as key to store the mean in the context, so that in :transform we can read it from the ctx under the same `id`.
The `id` passed into the function is the same in :fit and :transform (but unique per step)
So we see how to pass data from the same function in the pipeline run in mode :fit to the
run in mode :transform.

Conceptually this function is a pair of train/predict functions, which behaves like `train` in mode :fit and
`predict` in mode :transform.

["### Keep auxiliary data in pipeline"]
["As the context is a normal map, we can store arbitrary data in it. This means normally, that two steps work
together in some form, and a former steps writes some data to the ctx under a `known` key, which the later step
reads from the pipeline under this `known, shared` key.
The use cases for this  are left for the user of `scicloj.ml` to decide, the library does not interfere in this.

The moment these functions become re-usable and are eventually added to a library, namespaced keywords should
be used for the keys in order to avoid name collisions.

Typical use cases might be:

1. Some values of the dataset have been converted in some form, and we need to keep some information to convert them back
2. In a Natural Language Processing pipeline, the vocabulary is generated in one pipeline step, and needs to be used later
3. Some non-tabular data is generated during pipeline execution and should be kept somewhere

This features makes sure, that a pipeline can stay 100 % self-contained,
whatever data needed to be stored and makes the metamorph pipeline concept future-proof.

["### Pipeline evaluation and selection"]

a data pipeline or a model to a point where we do not know any more for sure, if a certain
modification of the pipeline or the model will improve the predictive
performance any further or not."]

or model parameters and select the best automatically. In the context of the
